We are building a Go CLI application named `gohour`.

Current status:
- The project uses Cobra and Viper.
- The app imports source files (initially Excel and CSV), normalizes them, and stores them in a local SQLite database.
- Example source files: `EPMExportRZ202601.xlsx`, `EPMExportSZ202601.xlsx`.

Configuration:
- Store these values in the config file:
  - `user`
  - `url`
  - `port`
  - `auto_reconcile_after_import` (boolean)
  - `epm.rules[]` with:
    - `file_template`
    - `project`
    - `activity`
    - `skill`
- CLI config management includes:
  - `gohour config create`
  - `gohour config show`
  - `gohour config edit` (opens current config in `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`/`vi`; creates example config if missing; validates after edit)
  - `gohour config delete`

Normalized worklog target model in SQLite:
- `StartDateTime`: date/time when work started
- `EndDateTime`: date/time when work ended
- `Billable`: billable time in minutes between start and end
- `Description`: text describing the work
- `Project`: project name (default from config)
- `Activity`: activity name (default from config)
- `Skill`: skill name (default from config)

Import architecture requirements:
- Multiple source formats must be supported (currently Excel and CSV).
- Source file structures may differ and must be mapped into one normalized worklog model.
- For every importable source format, it must be selectable how data is stored (`csv`, `excel`) and which mapping implementation is used.
- Mapping logic must convert source-specific fields into the normalized SQLite schema.
- EPM-specific mapping logic:
  - `Von` and `Bis` represent the full source-day window, not per-task start/end.
  - Task entries must be mapped sequentially.
  - If `Tagessumme` exists, compute one daily break as `(Bis - Von) - Tagessumme`.
  - Insert that break around the middle of the billable task sequence, so generated task times align to the original day end.
  - `project/activity/skill` are resolved per imported EPM file via `epm.rules` (pattern match by `file_template`) or explicit import flags.
  - No default fallback for EPM mapping values: if no matching rule exists and no explicit values are provided, import must fail.

Post-import verification/correction:
- Add an explicit reconciliation step (`gohour reconcile`) that can be run after additional imports from other sources.
- The step verifies and corrects overlaps on the same day by adjusting only EPM entries.
- Goal: for one resource, no overlapping worklogs in time.
- Reconciliation can also run automatically after every import (configurable and overridable per import command).

Output requirements:
- Output must be configurable.
- Initial output targets: CSV and Excel export from normalized SQLite data.
- A daily summary output format is required with:
  - `StartTime`: start of the first worklog entry of the day,
  - `EndTime`: end of the last worklog entry of the day,
  - total worked hours: sum of `(EndDateTime - StartDateTime)` for each worklog entry of the day,
  - total billable hours (sum of daily `Billable` values),
  - break hours (time gaps without worklog coverage between `StartTime` and `EndTime`).
- Later output target: REST calls to the secured company website for worklog submission.

Language requirement:
- All user-facing text, logs, command descriptions, comments, and documentation must be in English.
