# ROADMAP
## Already Done
- A Web UI that can be used to show current Onepoint entries and what would be submitted to Onepoint. With easy daily and monthly overview.
## Current
- A more user-friendly Web UI with a more intuitive interface where the user can change entries. And the possibility to import files and submit changes to Onepoint per day or per selection (month).

## High Priority
- a import of atwork file does not seem to work. no work log is persisted. try it by importing first [EPMExportRZ202601.xlsx](examples/EPMExportRZ202601.xlsx) and [EPMExportSZ202601.xlsx](examples/EPMExportSZ202601.xlsx) then the atwork file [excel-export-atwork-2026-03-fake.csv](examples/excel-export-atwork-2026-03-fake.csv)

## Medium Priority
- config show command does not show billable property yet
## Future Ideas
